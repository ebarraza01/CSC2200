<h2> About Me</h2>
I was born in Aurora, Illinois. I grew up on the east side of Aurora, by Farnsworth Ave. I attended public school up until high
school, when I attended <a href="http://marmion.org"> Marmion Academy.</a> Upon graduating, I decided to focus my career on Computer Science, with the goal of becoming a
Software Engineer. The university I would end up studying at was Aurora University, and after my first two semesters, my
interest in Computer Science has only grown greater and deeper.
